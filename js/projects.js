    Author License Platform Maintained

    üíª What are Amazon alexa skills? üë£
    Alexa is Amazon‚Äôs Voice Service, accessed through Amazon Echo. After the set up process, you simply say the word ‚ÄòAlexa‚Äô and Echo will light up and Alexa will respond. You can change this 'wake word' to either 'Amazon' or 'Echo'. Alexa can help you with music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, as well as providing weather, traffic and other real-time information.

    üíª What‚Äôs a skill?
    Alexa skills are like apps. You can enable and disable skills, using the Alexa app or a web browser, in the same way that you install and uninstall apps on your smart phone or tablet. Skills are voice-driven Alexa capabilities. You can add Alexa skills to your Echo to bring products and services to life. You can view available skills and enable or disable them using your Alexa app.

    üíª Where do I find my skills?
    You'll find all the skills on your Alexa app. If you're looking for the EDF Energy Alexa skill to complete the account linking process, type 'EDF Energy' in the search box. You can then follow the account linking process. Account has been linked, but can't find the EDF Energy Alexa skill? In your Alexa app visit 'My Skills' and search for 'EDF Energy' there.

    Description: `Often people have trouble programming in C (especially beginners) due to its low level syntax and unavailability of stable third party libraries. We present sim-C a high-level front end for C which creates a dynamically typed syntax for C. User can write code in this high level syntax and then compile it to optimized C code. sim-C does not process the code and simply translates it to C thus, there is no possibility of the code running slowly. So, with sim-C users can write code faster using the high level syntax and at the same time be able to harness the power and speed of a C program. Let us make C cool again.`,

    Vision
    To create a flutter clone of Spotify that uses the Recommendation Engine this project is based upon. A lightweight app with basic functionalities of Spotify i.e A Music Player, a playlist that belongs to the user, OAuth capabilities. Playlist functionality is important as it will serve as the basis for future music recommendations based on the features it houses. Goal is to use an implicit matrix factorisation model (originally proposed by Spotify's research team) for usage.`,

    So, this project is a little initiative from my side to help volunteers manage the classes and other day-to-day operations at Jagrati in a better way and make it easier for them to keep track of students, classwork-homework given to them, their attendances and other things and focus more on teaching than these side activities.
